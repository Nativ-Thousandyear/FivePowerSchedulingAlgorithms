# FivePowerSchedulingAlgorithms
Here are five algorithms related to power-aware scheduling and optimization in embedded systems, along with their code examples, explanations, and step-by-step implementation guides in C++:




1.Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS):
Requirement: Adjusting the voltage and frequency of a processor dynamically to optimize power consumption while meeting performance requirements.
Code Example:

cpp
Copy code
// Assume there are functions to read current workload and control voltage/frequency
void adjustVoltageFrequency() {
    int workload = getWorkload(); // Get the current workload
    int voltage, frequency;
    
    if (workload < THRESHOLD_LOW) {
        voltage = VOLTAGE_LOW; // Set lower voltage for low workload
        frequency = FREQUENCY_LOW; // Set lower frequency for low workload
    }
    else if (workload > THRESHOLD_HIGH) {
        voltage = VOLTAGE_HIGH; // Set higher voltage for high workload
        frequency = FREQUENCY_HIGH; // Set higher frequency for high workload
    }
    else {
        voltage = VOLTAGE_MEDIUM; // Set medium voltage for normal workload
        frequency = FREQUENCY_MEDIUM; // Set medium frequency for normal workload
    }
    
    setVoltage(voltage); // Set the voltage
    setFrequency(frequency); // Set the frequency
}
Explanation:
DVFS is a power optimization technique that adjusts the voltage and frequency of a processor based on the workload to achieve a balance between power consumption and performance. The algorithm reads the current workload and sets the voltage and frequency levels accordingly. Lower voltage and frequency are used for low workloads to save power, while higher levels are used for high workloads to meet performance requirements.

Implementation Guide:

Step 1: Define the thresholds (e.g., THRESHOLD_LOW and THRESHOLD_HIGH) to determine the workload levels.
Step 2: Determine the voltage levels (VOLTAGE_LOW, VOLTAGE_MEDIUM, and VOLTAGE_HIGH) and corresponding frequencies (FREQUENCY_LOW, FREQUENCY_MEDIUM, and FREQUENCY_HIGH) based on the specific embedded system and its power-performance characteristics.
Step 3: Create a function (adjustVoltageFrequency) that will be called periodically to adjust the voltage and frequency levels.
Step 4: Inside the function, read the current workload using a suitable method (getWorkload).
Step 5: Use conditional statements to determine the workload level and set the appropriate voltage and frequency values.
Step 6: Call functions (setVoltage and setFrequency) to apply the voltage and frequency settings to the processor.
Step 7: Call the adjustVoltageFrequency function periodically or based on specific triggers to continuously optimize power consumption based on workload.
