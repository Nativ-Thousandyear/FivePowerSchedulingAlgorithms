# FivePowerSchedulingAlgorithms
Here are five algorithms related to power-aware scheduling and optimization in embedded systems, along with their code examples, explanations, and step-by-step implementation guides in C++:




1.Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS):
Requirement: Adjusting the voltage and frequency of a processor dynamically to optimize power consumption while meeting performance requirements.
Code Example:

cpp
Copy code
// Assume there are functions to read current workload and control voltage/frequency
void adjustVoltageFrequency() {
    int workload = getWorkload(); // Get the current workload
    int voltage, frequency;
    
    if (workload < THRESHOLD_LOW) {
        voltage = VOLTAGE_LOW; // Set lower voltage for low workload
        frequency = FREQUENCY_LOW; // Set lower frequency for low workload
    }
    else if (workload > THRESHOLD_HIGH) {
        voltage = VOLTAGE_HIGH; // Set higher voltage for high workload
        frequency = FREQUENCY_HIGH; // Set higher frequency for high workload
    }
    else {
        voltage = VOLTAGE_MEDIUM; // Set medium voltage for normal workload
        frequency = FREQUENCY_MEDIUM; // Set medium frequency for normal workload
    }
    
    setVoltage(voltage); // Set the voltage
    setFrequency(frequency); // Set the frequency
}
Explanation:
DVFS is a power optimization technique that adjusts the voltage and frequency of a processor based on the workload to achieve a balance between power consumption and performance. The algorithm reads the current workload and sets the voltage and frequency levels accordingly. Lower voltage and frequency are used for low workloads to save power, while higher levels are used for high workloads to meet performance requirements.

Implementation Guide:

Step 1: Define the thresholds (e.g., THRESHOLD_LOW and THRESHOLD_HIGH) to determine the workload levels.
Step 2: Determine the voltage levels (VOLTAGE_LOW, VOLTAGE_MEDIUM, and VOLTAGE_HIGH) and corresponding frequencies (FREQUENCY_LOW, FREQUENCY_MEDIUM, and FREQUENCY_HIGH) based on the specific embedded system and its power-performance characteristics.
Step 3: Create a function (adjustVoltageFrequency) that will be called periodically to adjust the voltage and frequency levels.
Step 4: Inside the function, read the current workload using a suitable method (getWorkload).
Step 5: Use conditional statements to determine the workload level and set the appropriate voltage and frequency values.
Step 6: Call functions (setVoltage and setFrequency) to apply the voltage and frequency settings to the processor.
Step 7: Call the adjustVoltageFrequency function periodically or based on specific triggers to continuously optimize power consumption based on workload.



2.Energy-Aware Task Scheduling with Deadline Constraints:
Requirement: Schedule tasks on a system with multiple processors, considering their energy consumption and meeting task deadlines.
Code Example:

cpp
Copy code
// Assume there are functions to retrieve task information and control task execution
void scheduleTasks() {
    std::vector<Task> tasks = getTasks(); // Get the list of tasks
    std::sort(tasks.begin(), tasks.end(), compareByDeadline); // Sort tasks by deadline
    std::vector<Processor> processors = getProcessors(); // Get the available processors
    
    for (const auto& task : tasks) {
        double minEnergy = std::numeric_limits<double>::max();
        Processor* selectedProcessor = nullptr;
        
        for (auto& processor : processors) {
            if (task.deadline > processor.getEarliestAvailableTime()) {
                double energy = calculateEnergy(task, processor); // Calculate energy for task on the processor
                
                if (energy < minEnergy) {
                    minEnergy = energy;
                    selectedProcessor = &processor;
                }
            }
        }
        
        if (selectedProcessor != nullptr) {
            selectedProcessor->executeTask(task); // Assign task to the selected processor
        }
    }
}
Explanation:
This algorithm focuses on scheduling tasks on multiple processors while considering their energy consumption and meeting task deadlines. It sorts the tasks based on their deadlines and iterates over each task to find the best-suited processor that can execute the task before its deadline while minimizing energy consumption. The algorithm calculates the energy for each task-processor combination and selects the processor with the minimum energy for task assignment.

Implementation Guide:

Step 1: Define the Task and Processor structures/classes to represent tasks and processors with relevant attributes such as deadline, execution time, energy consumption, etc.
Step 2: Create functions (getTasks, getProcessors, compareByDeadline, calculateEnergy, and executeTask) to retrieve task information, retrieve available processors, compare tasks by deadline, calculate energy for a task on a processor, and execute a task on a processor, respectively.
Step 3: Inside the scheduleTasks function, retrieve the list of tasks using getTasks and sort them in ascending order based on their deadlines using std::sort and the compareByDeadline comparison function.
Step 4: Retrieve the available processors using getProcessors.
Step 5: Iterate over each task and initialize minEnergy to a large value and selectedProcessor to nullptr.
Step 6: For each processor, check if the task's deadline can be met by comparing it with the processor's earliest available time. If it is possible, calculate the energy for the task on the processor using calculateEnergy.
Step 7: If the calculated energy is less than the current minimum energy, update minEnergy and set selectedProcessor to the current processor.
Step 8: After evaluating all processors, if selectedProcessor is not nullptr, assign the task to the selected processor using executeTask.
Step 9: Repeat Steps 6-8 for each task in the sorted order.
Step 10: Once all tasks are scheduled, the execution will be optimized based on energy consumption while meeting the task deadlines.
