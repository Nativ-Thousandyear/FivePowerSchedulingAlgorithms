# FivePowerSchedulingAlgorithms
Here are five algorithms related to power-aware scheduling and optimization in embedded systems, along with their code examples, explanations, and step-by-step implementation guides in C++:




1.Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS):
Requirement: Adjusting the voltage and frequency of a processor dynamically to optimize power consumption while meeting performance requirements.



// Assume there are functions to read current workload and control voltage/frequency
void adjustVoltageFrequency() {
    int workload = getWorkload(); // Get the current workload
    int voltage, frequency;
    
    if (workload < THRESHOLD_LOW) {
        voltage = VOLTAGE_LOW; // Set lower voltage for low workload
        frequency = FREQUENCY_LOW; // Set lower frequency for low workload
    }
    else if (workload > THRESHOLD_HIGH) {
        voltage = VOLTAGE_HIGH; // Set higher voltage for high workload
        frequency = FREQUENCY_HIGH; // Set higher frequency for high workload
    }
    else {
        voltage = VOLTAGE_MEDIUM; // Set medium voltage for normal workload
        frequency = FREQUENCY_MEDIUM; // Set medium frequency for normal workload
    }
    
    setVoltage(voltage); // Set the voltage
    setFrequency(frequency); // Set the frequency
}
Explanation:
DVFS is a power optimization technique that adjusts the voltage and frequency of a processor based on the workload to achieve a balance between power consumption and performance. The algorithm reads the current workload and sets the voltage and frequency levels accordingly. Lower voltage and frequency are used for low workloads to save power, while higher levels are used for high workloads to meet performance requirements.

Implementation Guide:

Step 1: Define the thresholds (e.g., THRESHOLD_LOW and THRESHOLD_HIGH) to determine the workload levels.
Step 2: Determine the voltage levels (VOLTAGE_LOW, VOLTAGE_MEDIUM, and VOLTAGE_HIGH) and corresponding frequencies (FREQUENCY_LOW, FREQUENCY_MEDIUM, and FREQUENCY_HIGH) based on the specific embedded system and its power-performance characteristics.
Step 3: Create a function (adjustVoltageFrequency) that will be called periodically to adjust the voltage and frequency levels.
Step 4: Inside the function, read the current workload using a suitable method (getWorkload).
Step 5: Use conditional statements to determine the workload level and set the appropriate voltage and frequency values.
Step 6: Call functions (setVoltage and setFrequency) to apply the voltage and frequency settings to the processor.
Step 7: Call the adjustVoltageFrequency function periodically or based on specific triggers to continuously optimize power consumption based on workload.



2.Energy-Aware Task Scheduling with Deadline Constraints:
Requirement: Schedule tasks on a system with multiple processors, considering their energy consumption and meeting task deadlines.

// Assume there are functions to retrieve task information and control task execution
void scheduleTasks() {
    std::vector<Task> tasks = getTasks(); // Get the list of tasks
    std::sort(tasks.begin(), tasks.end(), compareByDeadline); // Sort tasks by deadline
    std::vector<Processor> processors = getProcessors(); // Get the available processors
    
    for (const auto& task : tasks) {
        double minEnergy = std::numeric_limits<double>::max();
        Processor* selectedProcessor = nullptr;
        
        for (auto& processor : processors) {
            if (task.deadline > processor.getEarliestAvailableTime()) {
                double energy = calculateEnergy(task, processor); // Calculate energy for task on the processor
                
                if (energy < minEnergy) {
                    minEnergy = energy;
                    selectedProcessor = &processor;
                }
            }
        }
        
        if (selectedProcessor != nullptr) {
            selectedProcessor->executeTask(task); // Assign task to the selected processor
        }
    }
}
Explanation:
This algorithm focuses on scheduling tasks on multiple processors while considering their energy consumption and meeting task deadlines. It sorts the tasks based on their deadlines and iterates over each task to find the best-suited processor that can execute the task before its deadline while minimizing energy consumption. The algorithm calculates the energy for each task-processor combination and selects the processor with the minimum energy for task assignment.

Implementation Guide:

Step 1: Define the Task and Processor structures/classes to represent tasks and processors with relevant attributes such as deadline, execution time, energy consumption, etc.
Step 2: Create functions (getTasks, getProcessors, compareByDeadline, calculateEnergy, and executeTask) to retrieve task information, retrieve available processors, compare tasks by deadline, calculate energy for a task on a processor, and execute a task on a processor, respectively.
Step 3: Inside the scheduleTasks function, retrieve the list of tasks using getTasks and sort them in ascending order based on their deadlines using std::sort and the compareByDeadline comparison function.
Step 4: Retrieve the available processors using getProcessors.
Step 5: Iterate over each task and initialize minEnergy to a large value and selectedProcessor to nullptr.
Step 6: For each processor, check if the task's deadline can be met by comparing it with the processor's earliest available time. If it is possible, calculate the energy for the task on the processor using calculateEnergy.
Step 7: If the calculated energy is less than the current minimum energy, update minEnergy and set selectedProcessor to the current processor.
Step 8: After evaluating all processors, if selectedProcessor is not nullptr, assign the task to the selected processor using executeTask.
Step 9: Repeat Steps 6-8 for each task in the sorted order.
Step 10: Once all tasks are scheduled, the execution will be optimized based on energy consumption while meeting the task deadlines.
    
    
    
    
Certainly! Here's another algorithm related to power-aware scheduling and optimization:

Genetic Algorithm for Power-Aware Task Allocation:
Requirement: Develop a genetic algorithm that optimizes the allocation of tasks to processors, considering power consumption and load balancing.

    
// Assume there are functions to retrieve task and processor information
void initializePopulation(std::vector<Chromosome>& population) {
    // Initialize the population with random task allocations
    for (int i = 0; i < POPULATION_SIZE; ++i) {
        Chromosome chromosome;
        for (const auto& task : tasks) {
            int randomProcessor = getRandomProcessor(); // Get a random processor
            chromosome.assignTaskToProcessor(task, randomProcessor); // Assign task to the processor in the chromosome
        }
        population.push_back(chromosome);
    }
}

double calculateFitness(const Chromosome& chromosome) {
    // Calculate the fitness of the chromosome based on power consumption and load balancing
    double totalPower = 0.0;
    double loadBalanceFactor = 0.0;

    for (const auto& processor : processors) {
        double processorPower = 0.0;
        int tasksOnProcessor = 0;

        for (const auto& task : tasks) {
            if (chromosome.getAssignedProcessor(task) == processor) {
                processorPower += calculatePowerConsumption(task, processor);
                tasksOnProcessor++;
            }
        }

        totalPower += processorPower;
        loadBalanceFactor += std::pow(tasksOnProcessor - (tasks.size() / processors.size()), 2);
    }

    return totalPower + loadBalanceFactor;
}

void evolvePopulation(std::vector<Chromosome>& population) {
    std::vector<Chromosome> newPopulation;

    while (newPopulation.size() < POPULATION_SIZE) {
        // Select parents for crossover
        Chromosome parent1 = tournamentSelection(population);
        Chromosome parent2 = tournamentSelection(population);

        // Perform crossover
        Chromosome offspring = crossover(parent1, parent2);

        // Perform mutation
        mutation(offspring);

        // Add offspring to new population
        newPopulation.push_back(offspring);
    }

    population = newPopulation;
}

void optimizeTaskAllocation() {
    std::vector<Chromosome> population;

    // Step 1: Initialize the population
    initializePopulation(population);

    int generation = 1;

    while (generation <= MAX_GENERATIONS) {
        // Step 2: Calculate fitness for each chromosome
        for (auto& chromosome : population) {
            chromosome.fitness = calculateFitness(chromosome);
        }

        // Step 3: Sort the population based on fitness (ascending order)
        std::sort(population.begin(), population.end());

        // Step 4: Evolve the population through selection, crossover, and mutation
        evolvePopulation(population);

        // Step 5: Increment the generation count
        generation++;
    }

    // Step 6: Retrieve the best chromosome (task allocation) from the final population
    Chromosome bestChromosome = population.front();
    // Use the best chromosome to perform the optimized task allocation
    performTaskAllocation(bestChromosome);
}
Explanation:
This algorithm utilizes a genetic algorithm approach to optimize the allocation of tasks to processors, considering power consumption and load balancing. It begins by initializing a population of chromosomes (task allocations) with random task assignments. The fitness of each chromosome is calculated based on power consumption and load balancing factors. The population then evolves through selection, crossover, and mutation operations to produce a new population. This process continues for a specified number of generations, and in the end, the best chromosome (task allocation) is selected and used for the optimized task allocation.

Implementation Guide:

Step 1: Define the Chromosome structure/class to represent a task allocation with relevant attributes and functions to assign tasks to processors, retrieve assigned processors for tasks, calculate fitness, perform crossover, perform mutation, etc.
Step 2: Create functions (initializePopulation, calculateFitness, evolvePopulation, and optimizeTaskAllocation) to initialize the population, calculate the fitness of a chromosome, evolve the population through selection, crossover, and mutation, and optimize the task allocation, respectively.
Step 3: Inside the initializePopulation function, generate a random task allocation for each chromosome in the population using getRandomProcessor to assign tasks randomly to processors.
Step 4: Inside the calculateFitness function, calculate the fitness of a chromosome by calculating the power consumption of each processor based on the assigned tasks and load balancing factor based on the number of tasks assigned to each processor.
Step 5: Inside the evolvePopulation function, create a new population by performing selection, crossover, and mutation operations on the current population until the new population size reaches the desired population size.
Step 6: Inside the optimizeTaskAllocation function, initialize the population using initializePopulation and set the generation count to 1.
Step 7: Repeat Steps 2-4 for each chromosome in the population.
Step 8: Sort the population based on fitness in ascending order using std::sort.
Step 9: Evolve the population using evolvePopulation.
Step 10: Increment the generation count.
Step 11: Repeat Steps 2-10 until the maximum number of generations is reached.
Step 12: Retrieve the best chromosome from the final population and use it to perform the optimized task allocation using performTaskAllocation.
